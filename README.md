# Linear Control System Lab
 Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Spring 2020

 ## Exp1 - Introduction to MATLAB and Linear Systems
 This assignment had two parts.

 ### Part 1: Stability  of Dynamic Linear Systems
In this part, three different linear systems were analyzed using MATLAB.

### Part 2: Open-loop Systems vs Closed-loop Systems
In this part, the differences between open-loop and closed-loop versions of a specific system were analyzed. I compared speed of reaching the settle condition of each of them while using a specific value for the Tao parameter and in the next step, the stability of the open-loop and the closed-loop systems were evaluated.
