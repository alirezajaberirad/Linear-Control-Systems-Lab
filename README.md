# Linear Control System Lab
 Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering - Spring 2020

 ## Exp1 - Introduction to MATLAB and Linear Systems
 This assignment had two parts.

 ### Part 1: Stability  of Dynamic Linear Systems
In this part, three different linear systems were analyzed using MATLAB.

### Part 2: Open-loop Systems vs Closed-loop Systems
In this part, the differences between open-loop and closed-loop versions of a specific system were analyzed. I compared the speed of reaching the settle condition of each of them while using a specific value for the Tao parameter and in the next step, the stability of the open-loop and the closed-loop systems were evaluated.

## Exp2 - Modeling and Simulation of DC Motors
In this assignment, a DC motor with the physical parameter mentioned in the last table of the "Modeling and Simulation of DC  Motors.pdf" file was created and analyzed using Simulink.

## Exp3 - Identification of DC Motor
In this assignment, first, by using MATLAB I launched a DC motor by given parameters. Second, I found the width of the dead zone of the simulated DC motor. And in the final step, the transition function of the DC motor by analyzing the step response of the system was identified successfully.
